# pazz

Totally offline, reproducible password generation + management. Passwords are not stored anywhere and can be reproduced anywhere.

You can use pazz at [takeiteasy.github.io/pazz](https://takeiteasy.github.io/pazz/). Or you can simple clone this repo or download the [zip file](https://github.com/takeiteasy/pazz/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Simply open index.html in your browser and you're good to go.

If you're paranoid, or interested in using pazz as a library, please see the [build](#build) section.

## Usage

Pazz needs a few things to work: a username, an identifier, a master password, a scope, a counter and a template.

</p>

First you need to add a username. This will be stored using `localStorage`. Once you have made a username you will be prompted for a master password. This is not stored and is not checked against anything. If you enter the wrong password your generated password will not be the same.

</p>

Once you've entered your password you will be presented by the sites screen. You may now add a site identifier to your user. A good idea would be using the web address as the identifier. Click the add button and the list of sites will be updated.

</p>

If you want to change advanced settings (scope, counter, template), you can click the 'Show Advanced' button. The scope is just another string that affects the password generation. Don't change this unless you know what you're doing. The counter is useful if you have been asked to change your password. And the template is the format your password will be generated in.

Now when you left click on the site identifier you will be presented with a generated password. Right click on the site identifier it will be copied to your clipboard.

## Build

If you want to build pazz yourself you can run the following commands:

```bash
# generate javascript
make web
# dynamic library
make library
# do both
make all
```

If you'd like to use pazz as a C library, simply include `pazz.c` and `pazz.h` in your project. The only requirement is the C standard library.

If you'd like to use the javascript library, include `pazz.js` in your project. See [pazz_helper.js](https://github.com/takeiteasy/pazz/blob/master/static/pazz_helper.js) as well for a wrapper over the generated javascript function.
